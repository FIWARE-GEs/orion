<p>You probably arrived here looking for the NGSIv2 Specification document :)</p>

<p>Instead of that, you should use the <a href="https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/blob/master/doc/manuals/orion-api.md">Orion API Specification</a>, which is based in the original NGSIv2 specification
but including all Orion improvements and enhancements built upon it. In addition, it is a more up to date, accurate, comprehensive and navigable
reference. Enjoy it!</p>

<p>However, if you are still looking the old NGSIv2 documents, they are available here:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../../archive/api/v2/">FIWARE NGSIv2 Specification</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../archive/api/v2/cookbook/">FIWARE NGSIv2 Cookbook</a></li>
</ul>
